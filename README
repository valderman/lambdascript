Lambdascript is a prototype language for strongly typed, lazy, purely
functional client side web scripting. It provides a basic subset of
Haskell's functionality, compiled into Javascript.

Due to its clumsy parser and fugly syntax, the plan is to scrap the thing
after it's more or less done (hence, prototype) and rewrite the project using
saner tools (BNFC is somewhat suboptimal for anything that's supposed to
actually be of any use) to enable some essential features (read: polymorphism)
and nicer syntax.

In order to compile LS, you need bnfc (get it from
http://code.haskell.org/bnfc/ or through your system's package manager if
you're on Debian or any of its derivatives.)
