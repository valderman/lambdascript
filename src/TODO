* Fix module system, which would consist of:
  + Add import directive to syntax
  + Whenever the type checker runs into an import, it should load and typecheck
    the module and put it into a list of modules to generate code for, unless
    the module was previously encountered.
  + Have codegen generate code for all modules in some arbitrary order
* Simplify boolean expressions
* Basic function inlining
* Remove laziness where it's unwanted. Or at least make an attempt.
