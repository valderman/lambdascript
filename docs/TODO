* Optimize calls between JS and LS; it's REALLY slow ATM. Since _jsfun will
  pretty much always be called with a string literal, we could just inline the
  call to it in 9 cases out of 10.
* Restrict type imports/exports (see Make.hs for details.)
* Find out why the code generator dislikes local functions.
* The codegen doesn't memoize local thunks; that's quite horrible, so we need
  to fix it.
